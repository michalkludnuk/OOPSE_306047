My overdue tasks are 15 and 17, as both of them are connected to inventory I added them in one executable file(./game).
All necesarry code for them is in files inventory.cpp , inventory.h, search.cpp, search.h, menu.cpp.
After winning a fight we drop an item which we can see in inventory, equip and search for one item among all items(there are 3 items).
